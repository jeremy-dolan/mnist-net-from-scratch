## Neural Net From Scratch

Neural network framework, with some demo applications and analysis.

* [neural_net_vanilla.py](neural_net_vanilla.py) - Complete feedforward neural
  network framework, written in vanilla Python for educational purposes. It is
  <!-- well commented and --> wildly inefficient. ðŸ™ƒ

<!--
* [neural_net_numpy.py](neural_net_numpy.py) - Complete feedforward neural network
  framework, written with NumPy. It is mildly inefficient.
-->

* [xor-and-linear-separability.ipynb](xor-and-linear-separability.ipynb) - This
  notebook discusses the XOR function and linear separability. We construct a
  multi-layer perceptron that learns XOR, and then analyze the trained network
  and graph its decision boundaries.

<!--
* [minst-net](3layer-minst-net.ipynb) - This notebook builds a digit classifier
  using the MNIST dataset. WIP.
