## Neural Net From Scratch

Neural network framework, with some demo applications and analysis.

* [neural_net_vanilla.py](neural_net_vanilla.py) - Complete feedforward neural network
  framework, written in vanilla Python for educational purposes. It is wildly
  inefficient. ðŸ™ƒ

* [xor-and-linear-separability.ipynb](xor-and-linear-separability.ipynb) -
  This notebook discusses the infamous XOR function and linear
  separability. Using our framework, we construct a multi-layer perceptron that
  learns XOR. We then analyze the trained network and visualize its decision
  boundaries.

<!--
* [minst-net](3layer-minst-net.ipynb) - This notebook builds a digit classifier
  using the MNIST dataset. WIP.
